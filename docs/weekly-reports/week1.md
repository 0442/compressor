# Week 1 Report

Hours Spent: ~3 hours

## Things done
  * Created a repository for the project with issues enabled
  * Registered the project on Labtool
  * Initialized poetry project
  * Did some initial research on LZ and Huffman algorithms
  * Completed the project Specification document

## Progress of the program
  I have not yet started to write the program. Poetry project is initialized.

## Lernings
  Basics of the Huffman and LZ algorithms.
  For Huffman compression, we create a Huffman tree based on the frequency of characters. The tree is traversed to create Huffman codes to represent the characters in a more efficient format.


## Challenges
  None

## Next Steps
* Continuing to research the algorithms.
* Beginning to implement the algorithms, starting with Huffman.
* Finding suitable sample files and testing the performance of the algrightms with them.
